        "back": "During graph traversal, it is important to track which vertices have been visited by marking them, often using a boolean array to avoid processing the same node again."

        "back": "BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that starts from a selected node and traverses the graph layer-wise, exploring neighbor nodes before moving to the next-level neighbors."
